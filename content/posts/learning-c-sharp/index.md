In my previous Introduction to C Programming post I covered some coding fundamentals which I won't repeat in this one. Instead, I will go over some differences between C and C#, such as OOP, and then using the Azure .NET SDK.

[Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) description of C#:

_"C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines."_

## Object Orientated Programming

## Classes

## Static Keyword

## Public/Private

## Methods

In Object-Orientated Programming, the term method is used instead of Function, and they are associated with a Class. Unlike in C where `main` is a function. In C# a method is within a Class.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
}
```

## Return Types

The `return` command can return information back to the caller.

`void` means nothing to be returned

`static int` means return an integer

## Properties

## Get and Set

## Handling Exceptions
